---------SET-UP---------

For this project, I have used Python 3.8.

Packages Used:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - math
    
These are all available via pip to install.

Each program is set up with parameters.  To get the parameters for any script type 'scriptname.py -h'.

In addition, each script has an associated makefile entry.  View the Makefile in any directory to see the commands that
were executed.

Without alteration, all makefile commands can be run on the command line with:

"make runScript"
