-------MODELING------

The contents in this directory contain the tasks associated with model development. 

Fraud is a problem for any bank. Fraud can take many forms, whether it is someone stealing a single credit card, to large batches of stolen credit card numbers being used on the web, or even a mass compromise of credit card numbers stolen from a merchant via tools like credit card skimming devices. 
 -	Each of the transactions in the dataset has a field called isFraud. Please build a predictive model to determine whether a given transaction will be fraudulent or not. Use as much of the data as you like (or all of it). 
 -	Provide an estimate of performance using an appropriate sample, and show your work. 
 -	Please explain your methodology (modeling algorithm/method used and why, what features/data you found useful, what questions you have, and what you would do next with more time) 



All of the work associated with this task is in this directory.  In addition, the following has been produced:
 - Creating the Modeling Dataset
 - Exploring correlation between fields
 - Selecting the model population
 - Excluding transactions and customers
 - Generating features 
 - Building and validating the model
