The S0_HelperClassLibrary is to house common code definitions and methods in which get reused over a number of time over
the code repository.  This also provides a clean location for usable lists. 

TODO: Add more functions to this library including:
- SummaryStats such as data shape, data info that can be used everytime that a new dataset is created.
- Drop lists
