-------DATA WRANGLING - DUPLICATE TRANSACTIONS------

The contents in this directory contain the general data investigations associated with Question 3: Data Wrangling.  In this 
question the following description was provided and three items were asked.

You will notice a number of what look like duplicated transactions in the data set. One type of duplicated transaction is a reversed transaction, where a purchase is followed by a reversal. Another example is a multi-swipe, where a vendor accidentally charges a customer's card multiple times within a short time span.
 - Can you programmatically identify reversed and multi-swipe transactions?
 - What total number of transactions and total dollar amount do you estimate for the reversed transactions? For the multi-swipe transactions? (please consider the first transaction to be "normal" and exclude it from the number of transaction and dollar amount counts)
 - Did you find anything interesting about either kind of transaction?


All of the work associated with this task is in this directory.  In addition, the following has been produced:
 - Sorting
 - Creating fields associated with differences from previous values 
 - Identifying duplicates 
 - Tagging duplicates 
 - Reporting on duplicates
